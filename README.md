# auth
Authentification Middleware for IRIS using gorm as a backend

Note : this is experimental at best, use at your own risk.

I'm actively working on this hence you might see change from time to time that might break features.

Once I'm satisfied with it achieving a correct functionnal level & usability, I'll release a proper v1.0.0
